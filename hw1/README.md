Personal touches currently added:
1) Restyled the Github, Project, and LinkedIn buttons with the icon class to remove the underline feature and instead have them just highlight blue when hovered over or clicked on, updated links to resume and Github buttons, as well as centered the Github/LinkedIn buttons under the Resume button. 
2) Added a light blue banner in the middle of the page that turns beige when hovered over with a mouse for aesthetic reasons. 
3) Added an arrow just above the "Email Me" button near the bottom of the page that uses an animation to blink and reappear constantly and turns solid when hovered over with a mouse.
